How to print on screen?
Int z = 10;
printf(“%d”, z);

If we want to print like
Total is 10;
printf(“Total is %d”. z);

Program:

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int x,t,z;
	x = 10;
	t = 20;
	z = x+t;
	printf("Total is %d\n", z);
	printf("Total of %d and %d is %d\n", x,t,z);
	return 0;
}

We have to place variables in order we want to display, system will not change anything automaticlly. 

–
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
	int x,t,z;
	x = 10;
	t = 20;
	z = x+t;
	printf("Value of X is %d",x);
	printf("Value of T is %d",t);
	printf("Total is  %d",z);
	return 0;
}
Output
Value of X is 10Value of T is 20Total is 30;

Here we can see there is no line change
What printf do.
When you type value of x is %d_ then here cursor will stop. Whatever you will write will start from _ after the line.
So to change the line we have to pas new line Character(\n) back slash n. 


printf("Value of X is %d\n",x);
printf("Value of T is %d\n",t);
printf("Total is  %d\n",z);

Output
Value of x is 10
Value of T is 20
Total is 30

Or we can do in same line with same output 
printf("Value of X is %d\n Value of T is %d\n Total is  %d\n",x,t,z);


How to Take Input?

We write
Int x; -> this means “RAM me x ke liye Memory allocate kar di jaegi.” 
X = 20; -> x ki value 20 set kar di jaegi. 

Value of x is 20
Address of the x is 716

When programmer use “x” then he will talking about value of x
But when he use “&x” ampersand then he is talking about address of x
printf(“%d”, x); // 20
printf(“%d”, &x); // 716

& - address operator. 

We need function which can make system in waiting state to take input. 

Scanf : scanf is a function that can be called to accept input from keyboard(Standard input Device). 
We need to give 2 instruction to scanf
What kind/Type of input is expected
Where to keep it in ram?

scanf(“%d”, &x); 
   		   716

It means whatever value you will pass to %d that will be placed whose address is 716 here. 

Printf & scanf ka prototype stdio.h header file me he.
